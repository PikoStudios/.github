## About Us

We develop tools that allow anyone to create high quality, fun games. Our biggest project currently is [Muzzle](https://muzzle.pikostudios.dev), a C99 Open Source Game Framework. We were started on November 11th, 2020. We have been working hard ever since to evolve our products and improve our skills

## Dedication to Open Source

we believe if a tool can benefit the public, it should be free and open to anyone, and we will be following that promise. Not only that, but contributing to Open Source projects is also very important. We have contributed to Open Source projects such as [sr_resolve](https://github.com/siddharthroy12/sr_resolve). As we use sr_resolve in our projects. We have contributed directly to the project and forked it and modified it to give the project a new life in the Muzzle Eco-system
